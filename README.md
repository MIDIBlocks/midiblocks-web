## Browser Support
This project works in all browsers that natively support the [Web MIDI API](https://webaudio.github.io/web-midi-api/). Currently, the following browsers have built-in support:

- Chrome (macOS, GNU/Linux, Android & Windows)
- Opera (macOS, GNU/Linux, Windows)
- Android WebView component (KitKat and above)
- Edge (Windows)

For more info, including on how to support Firefox, Internet Explorer, and Safari see the [WebMidi docs](https://github.com/djipco/webmidi#browser-support)

> Starting with version 77, [Chrome deprecates Web MIDI usage on insecure origins](https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/5138066234671104). This means that, going forward, the page will need to be hosted on a secure origin (e.g. https://, localhost: or file:///) and the user will need to explicitely authorize usage (no matter if sysex is used or not).

## Limitations

- **Generated code must be in ES5.** We use [JS Interpreter](https://github.com/NeilFraser/JS-Interpreter) to run code in a sandboxed environment which only supports ES5, but we will be providing ES6 support soon!

# Setup

- Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- Install [NodeJS LTS (eg 12.x.x)](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Open command line and install [Yarn Package Manager](https://yarnpkg.com/) with: `npm install -g yarn`
- Install [Quasar CLI](https://quasar.dev/quasar-cli/installation) globally with: `npm install -g @quasar/cli`
- Clone this repository into with: `git clone https://github.com/midiblocks/midiblocks`
- `cd` into the project and run `yarn` to install dependencies
- If you'd like, copy `.default.quasar.env.json` into a new file called `.quasar.env.json` (with a leading .) and change values to match your environment
- Run `yarn start` from the project's root to start the app at [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
- If you're using our [WordPress server-theme](https://github.com/midiblocks/wordpress) locally, set the build directory in `.quasar.env.json` to match your sites `/wp-content/themes/my-theme/` and run `yarn build` to build these files into there

### Command line scripts
```bash
# Start the app in development mode (hot module reloading, error reporting, etc.)
yarn start

# Build the app for production
yarn run build
```

## Dev Notes
- On startup, we check `!!window.app.boot` and either use it to populate the first render if it exists or load from server if it doesn't

## API
```bash
# Override the api baseurl (useful for testing between enviroments)
?apiDomain=https://example.com
```
