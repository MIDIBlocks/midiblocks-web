## Motivation

In 2018 when was homeless I met someone at a shelter who was there recovering from a stroke. This "woke me up" in a sense and since then I've been on a mission to help people unable to use a mouse and keyboard become content creators and performers.

The first step was to create [Handsfree.js](https://github.com/midiblocks/handsfree), a "Face Pointer" library that can be used to build gesture-based assistive tech and handsfree creative projects.
