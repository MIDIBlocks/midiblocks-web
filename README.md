## Motivation

Hi üëã I'm Oz Ramos and in 2018 when was homeless I met someone at a shelter who was there recovering from a stroke. This "woke me up" in a sense and since then I've been on a mission to help people unable to use a mouse and keyboard become content creators and performers.

The first step was to create [Handsfree.js](https://github.com/midiblocks/handsfree), a "Face Pointer" library that can be used to build gesture-based assistive tech and handsfree creative projects. This project received support from [The Studio for Creative Inquiry](https://www.cmu.edu/cfa/studio/), [Glitch.com](https://glitch.com), [Google PAIR](https://research.google/teams/brain/pair/), [the School of AI](https://youtu.be/CJDpF4xUieY?t=57), and generous support through Patreon, GoFundMe, and on Twitter.

The current goal now is to use Handsfree.js to design a handsfree coding environment with [Midiblocks](https://github.com/midiblocks/midiblocks). Ultimately, the goal to give people unable to speak or type to become handsfree creative content creators and real time performers (via generative music).

Ultimately, I'd like to develop a system that allows for real time, generative app development by literally day dreaming it (via brain waves and something like [GPT-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-3)) in the browser.
