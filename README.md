## Browser Support
This project works in all browsers that natively support the [Web MIDI API](https://webaudio.github.io/web-midi-api/). Currently, the following browsers have built-in support:

- Chrome (macOS, GNU/Linux, Android & Windows)
- Opera (macOS, GNU/Linux, Windows)
- Android WebView component (KitKat and above)
- Edge (Windows)

For more info, including on how to support Firefox, Internet Explorer, and Safari see the [WebMidi docs](https://github.com/djipco/webmidi#browser-support)

> Starting with version 77, [Chrome deprecates Web MIDI usage on insecure origins](https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/5138066234671104). This means that, going forward, the page will need to be hosted on a secure origin (e.g. https://, localhost: or file:///) and the user will need to explicitely authorize usage (no matter if sysex is used or not).

## Limitations

- **Generated code must be in ES5.** We use [JS Interpreter](https://github.com/NeilFraser/JS-Interpreter) to run code in a sandboxed environment which only supports ES5, but we will be providing ES6 support soon!

# Setup

## WordPress
- Install a vanilla [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) site (I use [Local by Flywheel](https://localwp.com/) to do this quickly)
- Install [CPT UI](https://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-post-type-ui/) and [Advanced Custom Fields Pro](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/)
- See [#wordpress-finalization]

## Quasar
- Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- Install [NodeJS LTS (eg 12.x.x)](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Open command line and install [Yarn Package Manager](https://yarnpkg.com/) with: `npm install -g yarn`
- Install [Quasar CLI](https://quasar.dev/quasar-cli/installation) globally with: `npm install -g @quasar/cli`
- Clone this repository into your `/wp-content/themes/` folder with: `git clone https://github.com/midiblocks/midiblocks-wordpress`
- Install dependencies by running `yarn` from the projects root
- Start the app with: `yarn start`

### Command line scripts
```bash
# Start the app in development mode (hot-code reloading, error reporting, etc.)
yarn start

# Build the app for production
yarn run build
```

## Dev Notes
- On startup, we check `!!window.app.boot` and either use it to populate the first render if it exists or load from server if it doesn't

## API
```bash
# Override the api baseurl (useful for testing between enviroments)
?apiDomain=https://example.com
```

# WordPress Finalization

The following will also need to be completed on your WordPress site
- Create a menu and add it to the `Main Nav Panel` [menu location](https://midiblocks.local/wp-admin/nav-menus.php)
  - Add [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery) classes (`fas fa-home`) and descriptions. You may need to click <kbd>Screen Options</kbd> and enable them to see these options
  - Add at least the following custom links: `/`, `/studio`
