# About

**Midiblocks is an attempt to simplify MIDI mapping and MIDI scripting to such a degree that it is usable by anyone, even those without coding experience.**

Midiblocks are small programs that are assembled visually using blocks ([powered by Google's Blockly](https://developers.google.com/blockly)). These blocks are triggered based on events like [Browser Events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events), [MIDI Events](https://webmidijs.org/docs/v2.5.1/classes/Input.html#events), [Webhooks](https://zapier.com/blog/what-are-webhooks/), and more. For example, here are three stages of a simple midiblock being composed with 3 blocks that together plays an Em chord on an MPK Mini when E4 is played on an APC:

You can also create custom blocks using JavaScript that others can use with our [monaco based](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/) IDE (more info coming soon):

Ultimately, the goal is to expose browser based creativity and machine learning libraries like [magenta.js](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/), [ml5.js](https://ml5js.org/), [p5.js](https://p5js.org/), [handsfree.js](https://github.com/handsfreejs/handsfree), and many others to MIDI devices (and beyond) under a single visual language that can be used by anyone on anything.

## Milestones
- Create a MIDI mapper and scripter that can be used by anyone, even those without prior coding experience
- A "GitHub/NPM for MIDI" that lets you quickly create, import, fork, and share MIDI mappings and scripts
- Create integrations with creativity libraries like [magenta.js](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/), [ml5.js](https://ml5js.org/), [p5.js](https://p5js.org/), and [handsfree.js](https://github.com/handsfreejs/handsfree)



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------



# Setup
## Prereqs
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [NodeJS LTS (eg 10.x.x or 12.x.x)](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Yarn Package Manager](https://yarnpkg.com/), install by running the following from the command line after installing NodeJS: `npm install -g yarn`

## Installing
- Open terminal and clone this repository with: `git clone https://github.com/midiblocks/midiblocks`
- Change into directory with: `cd midiblocks`
- Run `yarn` from the project root to install dependencies
- Run `yarn start` from the project's root to start the app at [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)


## Browser Support
This project works in all browsers that natively support the [Web MIDI API](https://webaudio.github.io/web-midi-api/). Currently, the following browsers have built-in support:

- Chrome (macOS, GNU/Linux, Android & Windows)
- Opera (macOS, GNU/Linux, Windows)
- Android WebView component (KitKat and above)
- Edge (Windows)

For more info, including on how to support Firefox, Internet Explorer, and Safari see the [WebMidi docs](https://github.com/djipco/webmidi#browser-support)

> Starting with version 77, [Chrome deprecates Web MIDI usage on insecure origins](https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/5138066234671104). This means that, going forward, the page will need to be hosted on a secure origin (e.g. https://, localhost: or file:///) and the user will need to explicitely authorize usage (no matter if sysex is used or not).



## Limitations

- **Generated code must be in ES5.** We use [JS Interpreter](https://github.com/NeilFraser/JS-Interpreter) to run code in a sandboxed environment which only supports ES5, but we will be providing ES6 support soon!



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------



# Dev


## Command line scripts
```bash
# Start the app in development mode (hot module reloading, error reporting, etc.)
yarn start

# Build the app for production
yarn run build
```

## Dev Notes
- On startup, we check `!!window.app.boot` and either use it to populate the first render if it exists or load from server if it doesn't



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------



# API

## Querystrings

Add the following to your URL to apply the commented effect:

```bash
# Override the api baseurl (useful for testing between enviroments)
?apiDomain=https://example.com
```
