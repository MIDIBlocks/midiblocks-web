# About this folder

Each of these `.xml` files represents a Block Library can be imported (1) into the "Block Factory" tab (5) of the [Blockly Dev Tools](https://blockly-demo.appspot.com/static/demos/blockfactory/index.html), modified, and exported back here.

Once modified, click on <kbd>Download Block Library</kbd> (2) to download it back into this folder. Then grab the JavaScript (3) code from the **Block Definition** panel (4) and paste them into the same-named file in the parent folder (`/src/blocks/`), replacing the code in the areas marked like:

```js
/**
 * ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ DO NOT EDIT BLOCK DEFINITIONS BELOW MANUALLY ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡
 * - To make changes, import ./backups/midi-events.js into: https://blockly-demo.appspot.com/static/demos/blockfactory/index.html
 * - Make edits there, then click Block Exporter
 * - Select ONLY "Block Definitions" in JavaScript format
 * - Copy paste code below
 */
```

Note that each of these Block Definition .xml files contain multiple blocks each, so remember to click on the Block Library (5) button of the Block Factory to learn more.
